# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These are placeholder references. To complete the extension, you should add actual PNG icon files with the vocabulary/dictionary theme.

For now, you can use any small PNG files renamed to these names, or create simple icons using any image editor.
